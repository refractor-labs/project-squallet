# Project Squallet: A Collective Wallet for Optimism L2s

## Introduction

Welcome to the Project Squallet GitHub repository! This project is at the forefront of Web3, enabling a trustless, group-controlled, multichain wallet optimized build on Optimism with an architecture founded on Multi-Party Computation (MPC). 
This wallet leverages federated Public-Private Key Pairs (PKPs) on the Optimism control plane to offer seamless and secure interoperability across multiple blockchain networks using Lit Protocols Chronicle chain.

## Key Features

- üîÑ **Multichain Wallet**: Support for multiple chains through federated PKPs.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Trustless Security**: Leveraging MPC for robust and secure key management.
- üåê **Universal Dapp Access**: Compatibility with all dApps and protocols.
- ü§ù **Community Driven**: Facilitated by a Safe smart contract wallet for group ownership and operation.

## Timeline

The journey began in Q1 2023 with research and development, culminating in a testnet implementation launched on August 2023. The wallet was initially deployed on the Chronicle L2 testnet using the Lit Protocol.

## Impact

### Real-world Applications

- üåâ **Closer Ties to Major Chains**: This project knits Optimism chains closer to major networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum by federating PKPs across all ESDCA chains supported by the Lit Protocol.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Universal Dapp Support**: Traditional smart contract wallets have suffered from compatibility issues with various dApps. Project Squallet resolves this by making all dApps and protocols universally accessible.
- üöÄ **Community Wallets**: Enables groups to launch cross-chain wallets owned and operated by the Safe smart contract wallet, democratizing access to cutting-edge DeFi protocols.

## Getting Started

Coming Soon.

## Architecture

### Control Plane on Optimism

The control plane of Project Squallet is anchored on the Optimism L2s. It utilizes Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for federated PKPs, establishing a robust and secure mechanism for key management and transactions.

### Permissions and Access Control

Permissions are enforced through a layered architecture, leveraging Optimism for the core access control logic. Once authorized on the Optimism control plane, users can seamlessly interact with other supported L2s.
